				<h2>Welcome to My CV Site</h2>
				<p>This is my CV site, thank you for taking the time to look over 
				it. I have predominantly worked in the IT field performing hardware 
				break fix solutions on a variety of product lines. However my passion 
				has always been for software and web development. The enjoyment 
				of constantly solving complex puzzles brings a sense of satisfaction 
				I've not found in any other field of study.</p>
				<p>The IT field in all categories is constantly and rapidly expanding. 
				Because of this, there is always more to learn, new ways to improve 
				myself. With every new skill learned there are more and more ways 
				to deliver better quality products that better suit a customer’s 
				needs. When I first started learning software skills, there was 
				a very limited range of what could be developed. Over time consumers 
				pushed for more, driving creativity and growth to unimaginable places. 
				It is something I have always been proud to be a part of. </p>

				<h3>Dot Net Framework</h3>
				<p>As a critical and evolving technology in software interconnectivity, 
				Microsoft's .net framework is an important area of study for many 
				applications.</p>

				<h3>Mobile Developement</h3>
				<p>The next generation of technology is making strong movements 
				towards mobile platforms and IoT devices. That makes it more important 
				than ever to have an understanding of developing software for these 
				platforms which meet customers' growing needs.</p>

				<h3>White Hat</h3>
				<p>White Hat or Ethical Hacking has only recently been given the 
				credit it deserves in fighting against malicious predators looking 
				to steal data and shutdown websites. Ethical hacking offers an agile 
				advantage over the standard software solutions in that it is capable 
				of keeping pace with the ever changing black hat threats.</p>

				<h3>HTML5/CSS3</h3>
				<p>HTML/CSS technologies have long been the building blocks of web 
				development and design. The new HTML5 and CSS3 discard a lot of 
				outdated practices and reinvent web development to meet a growing 
				need for sleek media driven content.</p>
