		<h2>A Little About Me</h2>
		<p>Despite the challenges I face growing up, I lived a normal life and accomplish 
		many milestones. I graduated from high school in 2004, continued onto community 
		college at JCC, then later transferred to Strayer University. For almost 
		ten years I have been with the woman I eventually came to marry. I have 
		consistently been able to find employment by applying myself to a wide range 
		of tasks from folding clothes, to plumbing, to running emergency break fix 
		on servers in a 24hr a day on call.</p>
		<p>Since my time in middle school I have always had an interest in IT. Throughout 
		high school, I took as many classes relating to the field as I could, eventually 
		joining STLP (Student Technology Leadership Program). Towards the end of 
		my high school career, I began to see that PC repair and PC building were 
		lacking the challenge I was looking for. Seeking these new challenges I 
		discovered the world of web development and programming. This seemed like 
		the kind of field which would constantly offer growth in learning and the 
		challenges I desired.</p>
