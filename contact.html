		<p>Thank you for viewing my CV site. If you would like to contact me regarding employment opportunities, please feel free to use the information below. I have a wide variety of skills and am open to many new experiences. Because my schedule can be uncertain, email is often the prefered method to reach me, but I monitor all regularly.</p>
		<p>Since my time in middle school I have always had an interest in IT. Throughout 
		high school, I took as many classes relating to the field as I could, eventually 
		joining STLP (Student Technology Leadership Program). Towards the end of 
		my high school career, I began to see that PC repair and PC building were 
		lacking the challenge I was looking for. Seeking these new challenges I 
		discovered the world of web development and programming. This seemed like 
		the kind of field which would constantly offer growth in learning and the 
		challenges I desired.</p>
